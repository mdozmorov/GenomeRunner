    ' NOTES:
    ' 
    ' 1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
    '    may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
    '    said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
    '    different sets of callbacks.
    ' 
    '    This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
    '    MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
    '    does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
    '    will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
    '    compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

    ' This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear fitter
    ' 
    ' These functions accept following parameters:
    '     func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func at given point x
    '     grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func and gradient grad at given point x
    '     hess    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func, gradient grad and Hessian hess at given point x
    '     rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
    '                 can be null
    '     obj     -   optional object which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
    '                 can be null
    ' 
    ' 
    ' NOTES:
    ' 
    ' 1. this algorithm is somewhat unusual because it works with  parameterized
    '    function f(C,X), where X is a function argument (we  have  many  points
    '    which are characterized by different  argument  values),  and  C  is  a
    '    parameter to fit.
    ' 
    '    For example, if we want to do linear fit by f(c0,c1,x) = c0*x+c1,  then
    '    x will be argument, and {c0,c1} will be parameters.
    ' 
    '    It is important to understand that this algorithm finds minimum in  the
    '    space of function PARAMETERS (not arguments), so it  needs  derivatives
    '    of f() with respect to C, not X.
    ' 
    '    In the example above it will need f=c0*x+c1 and {df/dc0,df/dc1} = {x,1}
    '    instead of {df/dx} = {c0}.
    ' 
    ' 2. Callback functions accept C as the first parameter, and X as the second
    ' 
    ' 3. If  state  was  created  with  LSFitCreateFG(),  algorithm  needs  just
    '    function   and   its   gradient,   but   if   state   was  created with
    '    LSFitCreateFGH(), algorithm will need function, gradient and Hessian.
    ' 
    '    According  to  the  said  above,  there  ase  several  versions of this
    '    function, which accept different sets of callbacks.
    ' 
    '    This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
    '    LSFitCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
    '    does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
    '    will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
    '    compile time - you can see them at runtime only.
